### **Personal Library App**
This project is a web application that allows users to manage their personal book collections.
With this app, users can easily add new books by title, author, and genre, edit existing entries, search through their collection, and delete books they no longer need. The app provides an intuitive interface for organizing and tracking a personal library, making it an ideal tool for avid readers and collectors.

Note: This app currently has no authentication, so any visitor can modify the contents of the library. This is intended to showcase the functionality of the website and should not be used for storing sensitive or important data.
